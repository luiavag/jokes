# jokes

This is the solution for Exercise: Web App APIs from ZTM (javascript)

The challenge is to use the a public API and build something fun.

In this example I'm using [JokeAPI REST API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2) to grab jokes in several categories and flags to filter them.

### `getJokes()`

The main function is `getJokes()` and uses the `async await method with fetch()` learnd in this section of the course
